# annotation-viewer

**Linux**:  
Create a conda environment from the `annotation-viewer.yml` file with
`conda env create -f annotation-viewer.yml -p PATH/TO/YOUR/CONDA_ENVS/FOLDER/ENV_NAME`

When in your conda environment (source activate ENV_NAME), start a local standalone server of the program with
`python run.py`
The viewer is then accessible from `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
